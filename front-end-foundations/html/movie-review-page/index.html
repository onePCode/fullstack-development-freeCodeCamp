      <p>The Interstellar movie poster, starring Matthew McConaughey. A striking image of an astronaut standing on an icy alien world, gazing at a distant horizon under a sky filled with stars and a massive planet looming above.
Interstellar is a mind-bending sci-fi epic directed by Christopher Nolan, following the journey of Cooper, a former NASA pilot tasked with finding a new habitable world for humanity as Earth faces environmental collapse. Alongside scientist Amelia Brand, Cooper travels through a wormhole to distant galaxies, confronting hostile worlds, the passage of time, and the enduring bond between a father and his daughter. With breathtaking visuals, an emotional score by Hans Zimmer, and a story that blends science with human connection, Interstellar challenges us to look beyond the stars and within ourselves.</p>
